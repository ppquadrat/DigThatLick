This file contains a log of errors fixed/indentified in DTL1000 metadata.
It is unlikely to be complete, but it creates a record of many steps in the
process.

-------------------------------
This section contains a log of the errors that were fixed (7-10/4/21, SD) in
the files:
	jazz/DTL1000/old/DTL1000-metadata-20210411.zip  (*.json)
	jazz/JazzEncyclopedia/old/JECompleteIndex_20210407.csv
An asterisk in the first column represents that the change is now present in the
DTL1000 JSON file.  A question mark represents points to check (many of which
have subsequently been fixed as well).  I also include some notes of remaining
issues, questions, etc.  See also old/dtlMetadataExplorer-errors-20210407.out

Note: "ldr", "arr", "cond", "comp", etc. are mapped to "other"
 - could be confused with "other" instruments

*There was a consistent error when the first name consists of initials only,
that these are omitted in the JSON file. (This results in a name beginning
with a space, which fails to match the surname.) These were corrected manually:

AQAZdBGlSOYSnNCJZoX2HR-T5NAWH9fR: split solo

Simon's mail 7/5/2021:  (attached file: missing_performer-20210507.csv)
I've updated the missing performer file to combine Klaus's and Andrew's updates (there were some updates unique to each, and some overlapping, and a few contradictions).   I filled in some gaps too.    I also deleted non-ascii characters (3 invisible ones and 2 é's which were converted to e.   Poor André!)

* There should be a few lines which don't match (where Andrew instructs us to cut a solo into 2 or more pieces).  If someone points me to where the segmentations are I could even fix these.   If there is more than one name in the corrected soloist column, these are the possible soloists.   There should be no cases where there are no names.   There is a new column (K) of notes which you can ignore, but I thought these were good to preserve as documentation.
 --> I checked the segmentations (highlighted) in Andrew's file against the
     metadata_full_compressed_v9_csv and DTL_1000_segmentations_csv in
	 dtl_1000-2021-05-19.  The DTL_1000_segmentations_csv is not up to
	 date and should be replaced for Geoffroy's next version -- Klaus sent new v
 --> The only inconsistencies I found were:
 	Thick Lip Stomp 1:46-2:23 should be split into tp/cor then cl, but only the
	first split is there.  If the second part is theme (not usable), then all
	is OK, otherwise this segment is missing.
	Son of ice bag 2:50-5:14  Split first minute sax, then tp
	-- was still all tp, but Klaus has fixed
 --> I updated remaining lines in missing_performers (see also below)


Klaus's mails 12/5/2021: (attached file metadata_full_compressed_v7.csv)
Compared to the latest version (v6) there are now 1711 (vs 1685) solos. There are also now 625 tracks compared to 622. One track_title changed its spelling from "South Street Exit" to "South Street exit".

In the last version, there were 33 solos without performer_names, now all solos have them. Five more tracks have now leader_name, but there are still 412 solo (from 129 tracks) without it, though only 5 solos without band_name and leader_name, but theese are coming only from two tracks, which are also two the four tracks (with 9 solos) which are missing solo_performer_names and possible_solo_performer_names. So finding the metadata for that four tracks would resolve nearly all outstanding issues. These are the track ids:

AQAI6kmyLEmkJEmkCF9-_DoeoeVAHb1x --> Paul Winter as/ts/bs confusion as above
AQAIUooShWGyKIOPLf7QH8kneUH0UPCD --> Paul Winter as/ts confusion as above
AQAMgFoUJkkToUrJ4VKG_Eh2_CiPqVmT --> Sims missing from lineup, boundary moved
AQAnQUwyJVKnJAgTJkmO5JTQR8nR8DuO --> ts missing
 --> i.e. these are all known issues dealt with above

On the other hand, there are four solos which have both solo_performer_name and possible_solo_performer_name, which should not happen I guess.

 --> fixed by Polina (see below)

But in total, 1699 out of 1711 solos have either one of them, which is good, as in the previous version 224 had neither one of them (and 0 had both), so a clear improvement.

Instruments, solo_start, solo_end, track_title, disk_title, session_dates are fully there, for area, medium_title etc. some values are missing.

Geoffroy's mail 18/5/2021: (attached link to DTL1000 JSON file)
so I added for all  (not only the 158 JE-*** mentioned below) entries  the information from the JECompleteIndex_cleaned.csv (after small tricks and some necessary changes to better match the current format of metadata_#metadata_full_compressed_v7_csv when it exist)

As you will see there are quite a number of redundant fields (coming from the various possible sources for the metadata); so we have to decide - whether we keep them all as it is currently, or if we only keep part of those

In all cases we would need some fine tuning (such as choosing which one is the current duration, ...)

Polina 18/5 (attached warning log file LOG_patch_metadata_21-05-18...)
? --> still need to check that the splits retained all information

Geoffroy 19/5
* --> issues with durations: to be checked

Simon 21/5
*Bug in code for solo names: 0 inserted in first decimal place when converting
from float to hh.mm.ss.xxxxxx e.g. 150.581405895692 is written 0.02.30.058140.
 --> fixed by Klaus; patch file supplied
?Is this what Geoffroy was talking about?
 --> Geoffroy found a different bug which Klaus fixed (new segmentation file)
 --> Klaus's totals are only of segments; there are some omissions;
     Klaus working on a revision

AQAQaJyySeICbQ-arDp-3JiVrfgDJkey: which of the solos at 1:54 and 3:25 is Pepper
resp Stitt?

? Simon patched the missing performers (20210519) file to match the
segmentations (new version missing_performers-20210522.csv)
 - check Polina's log for any errors; looks like everything matches

Simon's mail 20/5, updating list of issues as solved:
 - inconsistent versions of the segmentations -- Klaus sent new ones
 - Thick Lip Stomp 1:46-2:23; Son of ice bag 2:50-5:14 -- Klaus fixed seg
 - vibraphone "usable" but bass not? -- too late to change; can justify
 - PP: Unidentified date causing missing solos -- check

   for Ron Horton I added flhrn to instruments
 - PP: bug in parsing of instruments in JE with no space, e.g. "as,ts"
   e.g.  AQAnQUwyJVKnJAgTJkmO5JTQR8nR8DuO  Jackie McLean (as,ts) -- Polina fixed
 - metadata_full_compressed_v9 wrong album for AQALJpEeRhID5niCHU6YHndQ5oH3FeEv
   (via reasoning step instead of taking explicit value - we have mismatching
   album names and CD codes; should change name to original / current release
   -- check if this can be done in field naming at end
 - Polina's warning log: should be all fixed -- check
 - Geoffroy: problem with durations -- fixed

SD 20210811
Finished linking discogs and musicbrainz to Illinois data
 - see IllinoisMetadata.json for final output
 - see code in DTL-discogs.ipynb and MB-release-query.ipynb
 - matching to discogs performed first via an iterative approach: rough
   automatic match, manual identification of errors, finer automatic match,
   further manual identification and correction of errors
   (discogs-MPAL-corrections.txt, incorporated in Illinois/Corrections.txt)
 - matching to musicbrainz performed in a single pass followed by manual
   correction (MB-manual-corrections.txt)
 - for both, after correct identifiers were found, a subset of the available
   metadata was retrieved
During the process, errors were found in:
 - MPAL metadata (updated to version 20210810)
 - File and path names (updated in local mp3 versions, checked against MPAL
   metadata, and logged initially in discogs-MPAL-corrections.sh, but now in
   Illinois/Corrections.txt)
 - Previous and more recent corrections were initially in
   ~/mp3/dtl-scripts/DTL.err but these are also now incorporated in
   Illinois/Corrections.txt
